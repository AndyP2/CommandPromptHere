# Installation
1. Get the relevant *.inf files that you are interested in using depending on which versions of Visual Studio you have.
  - NOTE: if you are downloading the files directly from the GitHub portal UI, make sure to get the Raw files, not the HTML representation of it.
2. Once downloaded, just right click on the inf file and select Install.
